00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:26.500
Soon after World War II,
France was in need of a labor force.

2
00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:28.900
The government recruited
masses of North Africans,

3
00:00:28.937 --> 00:00:32.168
particularly Algerians.

4
00:00:32.207 --> 00:00:35.802
A migration of men began,

5
00:00:35.844 --> 00:00:39.803
but the law did not allow them
to bring their families.

6
00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:44.114
In 1974, Chirac's government wanted
to stop the continuing immigration.

7
00:00:44.152 --> 00:00:47.349
Wives and children were now allowed
tojoin their husbands and fathers.

8
00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:51.689
This was known as
"The Family Reunion."

9
00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:14.004
Move along, please.

10
00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.910
Move your hand!
Who are those children?

11
00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:23.617
They're my son's children.

12
00:01:23.658 --> 00:01:26.991
- And her?
- My son's wife.

13
00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:35.096
There you go.

14
00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.221
Thank you, son.

15
00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:54.815
Zouina!
My little girl!

16
00:01:54.856 --> 00:01:59.850
Zouina!
Let her go!

17
00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:05.188
Come on, don't leave
your children. Move yourself!

18
00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:07.929
My daughter!

19
00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.268
Don't listen to her, move!

20
00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:14.164
Mother!

21
00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.741
You stupid ass!

22
00:02:28.756 --> 00:02:30.656
Go!
For your children!

23
00:02:34.162 --> 00:02:37.290
You must go.

24
00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:44.061
- Don't leave me all alone!
- Let her go to her husband.

25
00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:46.869
Keep her, I'm leaving
with the children.

26
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:05.953
Hurry up!

27
00:03:05.994 --> 00:03:08.895
Shame on you.
Don't you fear God?

28
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.230
Hurry up! Move it!

29
00:03:16.137 --> 00:03:19.072
Mother!

30
00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:34.975
My little girl!

31
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:36.573
INCH'ALLAH SUNDAY

32
00:05:20.128 --> 00:05:22.756
I forgot he had a moustache!

33
00:05:22.797 --> 00:05:26.324
My son!

34
00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:30.133
I missed you so much.

35
00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:34.259
I'm well, my son,
thanks to God.

36
00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:42.247
I missed you so much.
And you, how are you?

37
00:05:48.623 --> 00:05:52.115
No, let me get that!

38
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.390
Let him, he works with me,
we call him "The Pole."

39
00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:37.298
Amina, come here!

40
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:42.339
Get inside!

41
00:06:43.578 --> 00:06:46.138
Mother, please go inside.

42
00:06:57.558 --> 00:06:59.583
Bring the box.

43
00:07:11.773 --> 00:07:14.105
Go inside.

44
00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:17.373
Well, Ahmed, my brother...

45
00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:20.312
goodbye,
I'm very happy for you.

46
00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.240
Your family is here,
by the grace of Allah.

47
00:07:23.284 --> 00:07:26.219
- Why don't you bring your family?
- Oh, no, I don't trust all that!

48
00:07:26.254 --> 00:07:29.223
"The Family Reunion"?
No way, not for me.

49
00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:33.626
I can't stand paperwork.
No trust.

50
00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:38.955
10 years-- it was too much.
They were there and I was here.

51
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:42.893
I'm fed up too,
but I have a house over there.

52
00:07:42.937 --> 00:07:45.428
We have to tighten our belts.
No choice.

53
00:07:45.473 --> 00:07:48.874
I agree with you,
but now they're here.

54
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.004
- Well, I must go now.
- Stay for a coffee.

55
00:07:52.046 --> 00:07:53.638
No, I must take the van back.
Goodbye, Ahmed!

56
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:55.911
- Stay!
- No, some other time.

57
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.215
Take good care of your family.
Go to them.

58
00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:06.224
By the way,
how about the guitar?

59
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.094
I play well now--
G major.

60
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:12.622
I'll play
at the workers' hostel.

61
00:08:12.667 --> 00:08:17.036
Things are not the same
there since you left, Ahmed.

62
00:08:17.071 --> 00:08:21.064
- Well, goodbye then!
- Close this.

63
00:08:21.108 --> 00:08:23.440
Here, you forgot
your briefcase.

64
00:08:23.478 --> 00:08:24.740
- Stay for coffee!
- I swear I must go.

65
00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:28.613
- Please stay!
- Next time, I promise.

66
00:08:30.017 --> 00:08:31.848
Don't forget me, okay?

67
00:08:33.754 --> 00:08:36.348
Good luck. Bye.

68
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.702
lam proud of you, my son.

69
00:08:46.742 --> 00:08:49.370
It's a real castle, my son!

70
00:08:55.918 --> 00:09:00.378
Come here, my son.

71
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:03.957
Give me the key
for the sugar and coffee.

72
00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:07.087
- There is no key.
- No key?

73
00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:09.597
I have a key to the house,
but not for the cupboard.

74
00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:13.068
Then give it to me,
and put a lock on the cupboard.

75
00:09:14.236 --> 00:09:16.204
My goodness.

76
00:09:19.408 --> 00:09:21.569
All this food
not even locked up safely.

77
00:09:21.611 --> 00:09:24.205
Rachid, Ali,
come over here.

78
00:09:24.246 --> 00:09:25.770
Come.

79
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.987
Mother, have a rest.
I'll be right back.

80
00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:48.984
Mother, my dear mother.

81
00:13:22.651 --> 00:13:27.611
He's been living alone for a year,
where did he get them from?

82
00:13:27.656 --> 00:13:32.184
That old Indian,
and all those brats!

83
00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.992
How should I know little flower?
We don't know him.

84
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.727
- We never see him.
- Quiet!

85
00:14:12.501 --> 00:14:16.562
"The award for the best
garden in town

86
00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:19.733
will be given
in three weeks.

87
00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:31.109
The winners will win
a trip to La Bourboule.

88
00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:38.825
The favorites of the contest--
Mr. and Mrs. Donze."

89
00:14:48.195 --> 00:14:50.561
I'm afraid this time
we're finished.

90
00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:59.038
Hurry up!

91
00:15:03.811 --> 00:15:06.302
You should've peeled them
faster and lay them at my feet.

92
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:11.016
You can't even
peel properly.

93
00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:17.790
Mother,
here is the key.

94
00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:20.063
God bless you, my son.

95
00:15:20.102 --> 00:15:24.471
I have no trust in you.
Thank God he made me a key.

96
00:15:30.904 --> 00:15:34.704
Damn you, mad woman,
the devil sent you!

97
00:15:39.346 --> 00:15:45.046
Tomorrow, I'll take you to school.
All you need is here.

98
00:15:45.094 --> 00:15:49.326
Bags, shoes,
coats, everything.

99
00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:50.798
You'll come back
on your own--

100
00:15:50.824 --> 00:15:53.816
Make sure you remember
the way. Understood?

101
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.839
Do you see that wall?
That's a factory,

102
00:15:57.873 --> 00:16:00.433
You must not go there,
am I clear?

103
00:16:00.476 --> 00:16:03.309
It's all broken-- dangerous.
Never go there.

104
00:16:03.345 --> 00:16:05.677
- It broke all by itself?
- Yes!

105
00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:08.205
- Why?
- It's dangerous!

106
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.219
There are thorny bushes
in the back.

107
00:16:11.253 --> 00:16:13.016
Just don't go there,
okay?

108
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.685
I'm scared.

109
00:16:16.725 --> 00:16:20.024
No, don't be scared,
Just don't go there.

110
00:16:20.054 --> 00:16:22.522
Now, I have
a surprise for you.

111
00:16:24.733 --> 00:16:27.224
A very nice surprise.

112
00:16:39.181 --> 00:16:42.344
- Look at this!
- Wow, it's beautiful.

113
00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.617
Amina, bring me that.

114
00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:56.621
Sit down.

115
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.637
Bring it.
Here!

116
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:52.940
That's enough music
for now.

117
00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:30.260
Look at the sage.

118
00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:33.024
Don't you think
it looks sick?

119
00:19:33.063 --> 00:19:36.396
- You think so?
- I'm telling you.

120
00:19:36.433 --> 00:19:39.960
In fact, if you'd listened to me
for the begonias--

121
00:19:41.672 --> 00:19:43.833
What--

122
00:19:45.609 --> 00:19:48.043
what is she doing
with her cauldron?

123
00:19:48.845 --> 00:19:51.405
Excuse me?

124
00:19:51.448 --> 00:19:53.473
Hello!

125
00:19:55.018 --> 00:19:57.282
You're not allowed
to do that here.

126
00:19:57.312 --> 00:20:01.305
What's your problem?
She's making me coffee.

127
00:20:01.358 --> 00:20:02.757
What the--

128
00:20:02.784 --> 00:20:04.843
Are you making
coffee for me? No.

129
00:20:04.886 --> 00:20:09.414
Coffee? No, you're not
in the Casbah here!

130
00:20:09.466 --> 00:20:11.400
Coffee--
inside the house!

131
00:20:11.435 --> 00:20:14.768
This is the Casbah,
and this is my son's house.

132
00:20:14.805 --> 00:20:17.569
- What?
- You don't like it? Shut up!

133
00:20:17.599 --> 00:20:19.931
- No!
- Yes, get me my coffee!

134
00:20:19.977 --> 00:20:21.706
Hey, that's enough!
Stop it!

135
00:20:22.746 --> 00:20:25.237
No respect
for the elderly!

136
00:20:25.282 --> 00:20:27.512
Her again.

137
00:20:27.551 --> 00:20:30.281
You'vejust arrived,
and she's already bugging you.

138
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.685
Hello, neighbor!

139
00:20:33.056 --> 00:20:36.048
- What's your name?
- Zouina.

140
00:20:36.084 --> 00:20:38.018
Oh, it sounds
like the South.

141
00:20:38.061 --> 00:20:39.221
Come on, let's go.

142
00:20:40.389 --> 00:20:43.916
I'm Miss Briat,
you can call me Nicole.

143
00:20:43.967 --> 00:20:48.870
Oh, Nicool.
I know that name, Nicool.

144
00:20:48.897 --> 00:20:51.661
We've seen your husband
alone for a while now.

145
00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:55.363
He's a handsome man...

146
00:20:55.412 --> 00:20:57.539
I must say
he's not a womanizer.

147
00:21:00.142 --> 00:21:02.667
Well then,
I'd better get going.

148
00:21:02.719 --> 00:21:05.210
I work at the factory--
you know, cosmetics.

149
00:21:05.247 --> 00:21:08.546
Make-up-- you know.
Well, that's me.

150
00:21:08.592 --> 00:21:11.083
Well, see you later.

151
00:21:11.119 --> 00:21:12.416
You can come
for a coffee later.

152
00:21:14.631 --> 00:21:17.429
You-- get inside,
hurry up!

153
00:21:17.467 --> 00:21:20.027
You, "trouble face."

154
00:21:58.709 --> 00:22:00.904
And now, Henry Kubnik's
"One Thousand Francs" game.

155
00:22:00.944 --> 00:22:04.175
Directed by Pierre Duflot,
and hosted by Lucien Jeunesse.

156
00:22:07.651 --> 00:22:10.176
Only one answer.
Ready?

157
00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.654
What very
special invention was made

158
00:22:12.689 --> 00:22:18.025
by the French astronomer
Ernest Esclangon,

159
00:22:18.061 --> 00:22:21.189
Ernest Esclangon--

160
00:22:21.231 --> 00:22:25.497
born in the Lower Alpes
in 1876’?

161
00:22:31.575 --> 00:22:35.511
She just arrived, and she causes
a scandal with the neighbors.

162
00:22:39.716 --> 00:22:42.685
Think carefully--
every second counts.

163
00:22:52.028 --> 00:22:54.155
I need a precise answer.

164
00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.942
The Time of Day.

165
00:23:08.979 --> 00:23:12.415
Of course,
the Time of Day!

166
00:23:12.441 --> 00:23:15.308
I said,
every second counts.

167
00:25:07.397 --> 00:25:10.833
Paper and pens!
Is that tonight's dinner?

168
00:25:11.943 --> 00:25:13.672
God, give me patience!

169
00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:20.146
Keep writing!

170
00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:25.213
So you'll be clever
when you grow up.

171
00:25:25.256 --> 00:25:28.851
Ahmed is learning
to write too, just like you.

172
00:25:28.894 --> 00:25:33.092
When he gets home,
show him what you did at school.

173
00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.996
Study well.

174
00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:38.366
But Daddy is older.

175
00:25:38.403 --> 00:25:40.268
He'll be able to write
better than me.

176
00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:42.364
God willing! God willing!

177
00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:46.063
I said write,
don't draw!

178
00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:49.370
You're mean!

179
00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:52.178
What is "mean"?
I don't understand.

180
00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:57.553
- Why are you mean?
- Me, mean? That's a good one!

181
00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.454
You always shout
at my mama.

182
00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:01.925
When she sees me,
she frowns... like this.

183
00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.860
I never did anything
wrong to her.

184
00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:09.825
She's always yakking
with the French women.

185
00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:15.672
Nothing for me.
She doesn't bring me coffee,

186
00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:15.729
she doesn't cook for me
or anything.

187
00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:22.409
Well, you just have
to ask her.

188
00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:26.178
I'm fed up
with asking her all the time.

189
00:26:26.217 --> 00:26:28.811
That's enough,
finish your homework.

190
00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:54.370
Mommy, when do we
celebrate the A'I'd’?

191
00:26:54.412 --> 00:26:56.778
In three Sundays,
God willing.

192
00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:59.545
We get...
when we get presents?

193
00:26:59.584 --> 00:27:02.451
There are no Algerians
like us here.

194
00:27:02.487 --> 00:27:05.354
Who are we going
to offer cakes to?

195
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.881
To the neighbors?

196
00:27:15.525 --> 00:27:18.323
We have no relatives here.

197
00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.032
Who are we
going to offer cakes to?

198
00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:38.184
That's enough, stop it,
you can't do that here.

199
00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:40.453
We have rules here,
no balls allowed.

200
00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:43.222
Can't you see
this is a garden here?

201
00:27:46.898 --> 00:27:49.526
Ali, what have you done!

202
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.624
Murderers! Slaughterers!

203
00:28:01.112 --> 00:28:02.807
Oh, my God,
what is she doing?

204
00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:15.825
Poor Ahmed who brought you
from Algeria--

205
00:28:15.852 --> 00:28:17.046
I'm calling the police.

206
00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:20.783
You disgrace us
in front of the neighbors!

207
00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:22.595
You take
all your clothes off--

208
00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:25.034
you mad woman!

209
00:28:27.397 --> 00:28:29.763
Mommy, please stop!

210
00:28:36.806 --> 00:28:40.264
If Ahmed doesn't beat you for that,
I'll deny my religion!

211
00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:56.359
What's going on?
We have our papers.

212
00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:59.234
Curse the devil.
Today your wife...

213
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.603
lifted her skirt in front
of the neighbors and disgraced us.

214
00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:04.302
- When?
- This morning.

215
00:29:04.342 --> 00:29:06.003
We are legal here.

216
00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:08.808
I believe you,
it's not about papers.

217
00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:12.783
It's the neighbor.
She filed a complaint.

218
00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:14.876
It's been a mess here
for two days.

219
00:29:14.919 --> 00:29:15.886
What mess?

220
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.718
- I've had enough!
- I'm not talking to you!

221
00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.224
- Two days!
- I don't know him.

222
00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:22.988
- I don't talk to you!
- Sir, go home.

223
00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:24.824
I don't talk to you!

224
00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:26.296
Mr. Lancelin,
please not now!

225
00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:30.631
Don't protect these people.
I've known you since you were a kid.

226
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:33.467
- Damn you!
- Calm down, my son.

227
00:29:33.504 --> 00:29:36.064
Curse the devil, my son.

228
00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:47.446
I need to fill in
a report, now.

229
00:29:47.485 --> 00:29:51.251
Sir, she lifted her skirt
up to here.

230
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:54.114
- What?
- Her skirt-- to here.

231
00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:55.820
Her skirt?

232
00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.318
Please, be quiet!

233
00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:02.458
I was told about a rooster.

234
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.195
- Flowers?
- Rooster? What rooster?

235
00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:07.534
A rooster, yes, strangling,
I have nothing on a skirt.

236
00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:10.564
- Well, I'm taking notes.
- What notes?

237
00:30:10.608 --> 00:30:13.304
I must take notes.
It's myjob.

238
00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:15.312
I need you to calm down.

239
00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:20.648
She lifted her skirt up to here
in front of the neighbors.

240
00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:25.952
Now I need to pay a visit
to the Donzes.

241
00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:30.154
- Excuse me!
- Thank you, sir.

242
00:30:30.195 --> 00:30:32.254
You're welcome.

243
00:30:45.777 --> 00:30:48.507
What's all this
about the skirt?

244
00:30:50.348 --> 00:30:52.714
Will you be okay?

245
00:30:58.022 --> 00:31:00.616
Is your wife here?

246
00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:02.649
I'm with Mr. and Mrs. Donze.

247
00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:05.026
Come here!

248
00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:11.365
lthink
the case is settled now.

249
00:31:11.402 --> 00:31:12.164
Come on!

250
00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:15.798
Mrs. Donze is ready
to withdraw her complaint.

251
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.276
Go on, Lucienne,
shake the lady's hand.

252
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.743
Go ahead, move.

253
00:31:20.778 --> 00:31:23.645
You are neighbors,
you must shake hands.

254
00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:27.276
Go on, Lucienne!

255
00:31:27.318 --> 00:31:29.582
Shake hands with her.

256
00:31:32.256 --> 00:31:34.724
Let's get on with it!

257
00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:40.197
Pest!

258
00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:42.290
Good evening.

259
00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:44.460
Get inside.

260
00:31:45.903 --> 00:31:48.235
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

261
00:31:51.334 --> 00:31:54.030
I go to work,
and you bring the police here?

262
00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:55.067
It's not me.

263
00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.418
Damn you and your roots!

264
00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:04.250
You bring the police
into my house, God damn you!

265
00:32:04.288 --> 00:32:05.880
God damn you!

266
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.124
Get out of my way.

267
00:32:23.917 --> 00:32:26.147
Slow down!

268
00:32:30.323 --> 00:32:32.587
Come on,
give me your hand.

269
00:32:36.496 --> 00:32:38.760
Wait.

270
00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:45.232
Come here,
give me your hand.

271
00:32:45.271 --> 00:32:47.034
Let's go.

272
00:32:48.074 --> 00:32:49.598
This way.

273
00:33:19.605 --> 00:33:21.903
Hello, Zouina!

274
00:33:28.748 --> 00:33:31.273
- Nicool, how are you?
- Hi.

275
00:33:31.317 --> 00:33:33.945
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.

276
00:33:33.987 --> 00:33:36.649
- Have coffee with me.
- No, thanks, I'm late.

277
00:33:36.689 --> 00:33:38.850
Yes, have
a coffee with me.

278
00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:43.055
By God, have some coffee.
You, go and make it.

279
00:33:44.672 --> 00:33:46.867
Nicool, come here.

280
00:33:48.368 --> 00:33:50.461
Sit right here.

281
00:33:58.278 --> 00:34:01.475
- Nice sofa.
- Thank you.

282
00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:06.444
It reminds me of my friend
Brigitte's in Paris.

283
00:34:06.485 --> 00:34:08.851
She had
the same sheepskin.

284
00:34:08.888 --> 00:34:11.118
But it was
on her back!

285
00:34:12.525 --> 00:34:15.119
Are you
making fun of me?

286
00:34:15.161 --> 00:34:16.788
Go get the coffee!

287
00:34:21.075 --> 00:34:24.101
I must go!

288
00:34:24.136 --> 00:34:25.694
- I'll come back, promise!
- Stay!

289
00:34:25.738 --> 00:34:28.070
- No, but I'll come back!
- Why?

290
00:34:28.107 --> 00:34:31.338
- I'll come back, okay?
- All right!

291
00:34:31.377 --> 00:34:34.744
ljust passed by, because
I heard about that loony.

292
00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:38.273
She called the police?
Shame I wasn't here!

293
00:34:38.317 --> 00:34:39.978
What are you whispering?

294
00:34:40.028 --> 00:34:43.088
What did she say?

295
00:34:43.122 --> 00:34:45.989
- Don't smoke here!
- Whatever.

296
00:34:46.025 --> 00:34:48.585
Well, I must go.
Bye!

297
00:34:50.271 --> 00:34:52.296
Unbelievable.

298
00:35:01.307 --> 00:35:03.502
God, put us
on the right path

299
00:35:03.543 --> 00:35:06.034
Peace on you.

300
00:35:09.715 --> 00:35:11.615
God, open up
the doors.

301
00:35:11.651 --> 00:35:15.382
God, ease this confusion
on us and our children.

302
00:35:15.421 --> 00:35:17.446
God...

303
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.617
your people
are in distress.

304
00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:21.058
One and only God...

305
00:35:21.093 --> 00:35:24.620
Save my children and every
born child in this world.

306
00:35:24.664 --> 00:35:27.064
Praise the Lord.

307
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.807
Hi, Mommy.

308
00:35:42.849 --> 00:35:45.044
I have a friend.

309
00:35:45.084 --> 00:35:47.177
- A friend?
- Yes.

310
00:35:47.553 --> 00:35:49.919
Come and eat your snack.

311
00:35:52.792 --> 00:35:55.761
Come on, Nicolas!

312
00:35:55.795 --> 00:35:58.491
Mommy, Nicolas knows
an Algerian family.

313
00:35:58.531 --> 00:36:00.795
- You know an Algerian family?
- Like us.

314
00:36:00.833 --> 00:36:04.325
An Algerian family like us?
Who are they?

315
00:36:11.477 --> 00:36:13.741
Bouira.

316
00:36:14.781 --> 00:36:16.646
Where?

317
00:36:16.682 --> 00:36:19.082
12 Alouette Street.

318
00:36:20.353 --> 00:36:22.719
So now we can
celebrate the A'I'd’?

319
00:36:22.755 --> 00:36:23.949
Write it down.

320
00:36:22.755 --> 00:36:25.121
Write...

321
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.428
Don't tell anyone!

322
00:36:36.469 --> 00:36:38.869
Here she is!

323
00:36:38.904 --> 00:36:40.929
Who is this boy?

324
00:36:40.973 --> 00:36:42.998
- He's a friend!
- Your friend?

325
00:36:43.042 --> 00:36:45.567
- Nicolas!
- Come with me!

326
00:36:47.613 --> 00:36:51.174
Let me tell you the tale
of the egress.

327
00:36:51.217 --> 00:36:53.811
Come and sit down.

328
00:36:57.456 --> 00:37:00.254
Sit still,
look me in the eyes!

329
00:37:00.893 --> 00:37:04.727
When the egress
catches the children,

330
00:37:04.763 --> 00:37:07.493
she devours their ears...

331
00:37:07.533 --> 00:37:10.058
cuts the little
girls' throats.

332
00:37:11.946 --> 00:37:15.143
The little girls,
she cuts their heads off.

333
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.615
See, he is frightened!

334
00:37:21.647 --> 00:37:23.706
The egress slaughters...

335
00:37:23.758 --> 00:37:25.749
...all the little girls.

336
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.316
- Who is he?
- He's my friend.

337
00:37:30.356 --> 00:37:32.551
Your friend?
How are you, Mom?

338
00:37:32.592 --> 00:37:34.560
Fine, my son.

339
00:37:34.594 --> 00:37:37.654
He knows
an Algerian family.

340
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.370
So he's your friend?

341
00:37:48.015 --> 00:37:50.074
Children, come here.

342
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.872
Sit down.

343
00:37:59.051 --> 00:38:02.680
Listen to what
I have to say.

344
00:38:02.722 --> 00:38:07.318
You must behave at school,
and on the way back.

345
00:38:07.359 --> 00:38:09.827
No more scandal,
like with the ball.

346
00:38:09.862 --> 00:38:12.490
- It was Ali.
- Ali?

347
00:38:12.531 --> 00:38:15.159
Mrs. Donze
killed the ball.

348
00:38:16.002 --> 00:38:19.130
This is not our house.

349
00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:20.729
Why?

350
00:38:20.773 --> 00:38:23.571
- It is not our house, that's all.
- Is it the boss's house?

351
00:38:23.609 --> 00:38:27.101
Mother, come here.
Get her a chair.

352
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.473
What is the boss's name?

353
00:38:30.516 --> 00:38:33.212
Durieux, or Dupuis.

354
00:38:37.723 --> 00:38:39.520
On Sunday...

355
00:38:39.567 --> 00:38:43.697
I don't have to work,
we'll go get a sheep...

356
00:38:43.738 --> 00:38:47.003
from a Moroccan guy
who lives in the country.

357
00:38:47.032 --> 00:38:51.196
- A sheep?
- Can I come?

358
00:38:51.237 --> 00:38:53.762
- No, you can't!
- Keep quiet!

359
00:38:53.814 --> 00:38:57.648
- Why Moroccan?
- It's the same.

360
00:38:57.677 --> 00:39:01.306
- There is no Algerian?
- No, only a Moroccan.

361
00:39:01.347 --> 00:39:03.713
I prefer an Algerian...

362
00:39:03.749 --> 00:39:06.650
who knows
how to fatten up sheeps.

363
00:39:06.686 --> 00:39:09.416
But you decide.

364
00:39:09.455 --> 00:39:12.686
- It's up to you, son.
- They're all the same.

365
00:39:12.725 --> 00:39:15.353
Sheeps here
are French anyway.

366
00:39:15.394 --> 00:39:18.158
- Who are you going with?
- "The Pole"...

367
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.161
and his van.

368
00:39:45.057 --> 00:39:47.457
Just a few more days.

369
00:39:49.562 --> 00:39:51.689
A few short days.

370
00:39:56.244 --> 00:39:58.678
I'm protecting you.

371
00:40:47.461 --> 00:40:51.261
Rachid, don't open
the door to anyone.

372
00:40:51.299 --> 00:40:54.325
- And me?
- You stay with your mother.

373
00:40:56.604 --> 00:40:58.162
Here's the Pole.

374
00:40:58.205 --> 00:41:01.641
- Where are you going?
- To get the sheep.

375
00:41:16.557 --> 00:41:19.082
Come quickly.

376
00:41:20.636 --> 00:41:22.729
Where are we going?

377
00:41:25.566 --> 00:41:27.500
Where?

378
00:41:28.502 --> 00:41:31.164
You're not allowed
to go out.

379
00:41:36.811 --> 00:41:40.611
Mama, we're not allowed
to leave the house.

380
00:41:40.648 --> 00:41:44.140
- I'll tell Dad.
- Mama, you know we're not allowed!

381
00:41:44.185 --> 00:41:47.279
If you tell him,
he'll kill me.

382
00:41:50.557 --> 00:41:53.287
Where are we going?

383
00:43:41.268 --> 00:43:43.600
No more tears.

384
00:43:43.637 --> 00:43:46.003
It hurts the dead.

385
00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:53.307
Hello!
This is Simca.

386
00:43:53.347 --> 00:43:56.248
Madame, please--

387
00:43:56.283 --> 00:43:58.877
lam lost.

388
00:43:58.919 --> 00:44:01.046
We are looking
for the Bouiras.

389
00:44:01.088 --> 00:44:03.579
Bouira, from Algeria.

390
00:44:03.624 --> 00:44:08.960
lsee... Algeria.
So, you too?

391
00:44:08.996 --> 00:44:11.692
Can I play
with the dog?

392
00:44:11.732 --> 00:44:13.700
Yes, of course!

393
00:44:16.003 --> 00:44:20.269
It's been 11 years
since I lost my dear Henry.

394
00:44:20.307 --> 00:44:23.470
He is somewhere
over there--

395
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:25.944
in Algeria.

396
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.177
In the mountains
of Kabylia.

397
00:44:29.224 --> 00:44:32.716
His body
was never recovered.

398
00:44:37.658 --> 00:44:40.889
He must rest here,
no matter what.

399
00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:47.494
Maybe the Bouiras
are from Kabylia’?

400
00:44:58.846 --> 00:45:01.474
- Whose children are they?
- Hers.

401
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:10.284
- And the dog?
- It belongs to the lady.

402
00:45:10.324 --> 00:45:15.057
- There's been an accident!
- What happened to Simca’?

403
00:45:15.104 --> 00:45:17.800
- What happened?
- The dog was hit.

404
00:45:17.831 --> 00:45:21.358
- Madame!
- No, not Simca!

405
00:45:21.402 --> 00:45:24.462
Madame, the children are fine.
It's just the dog, it's all right.

406
00:45:24.504 --> 00:45:27.200
Take her
to the hospital.

407
00:46:07.581 --> 00:46:10.015
Hey, Donze, wake up!

408
00:46:11.952 --> 00:46:15.285
It's the neighbor.
There's even a military convoy.

409
00:46:21.395 --> 00:46:23.295
I said, come here!

410
00:46:40.047 --> 00:46:42.811
lcan't see
a damn thing.

411
00:47:10.544 --> 00:47:12.273
Hurry up.

412
00:47:40.374 --> 00:47:43.366
What's going on here?

413
00:47:45.512 --> 00:47:47.377
Come here.

414
00:47:52.052 --> 00:47:53.713
Dad.

415
00:48:09.469 --> 00:48:13.166
Where's dinner?
Is this dinner?

416
00:48:13.206 --> 00:48:15.834
What did you do
all day?

417
00:48:15.876 --> 00:48:17.844
- I was sick.
- Sick?

418
00:48:17.878 --> 00:48:19.641
The children too.

419
00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.240
You forgot Arabic.
You speak French now?

420
00:48:22.282 --> 00:48:24.716
Did your mother feed you?

421
00:48:24.751 --> 00:48:27.117
No, you haven't eaten?

422
00:48:27.154 --> 00:48:29.679
See what I have
to put up with.

423
00:48:29.723 --> 00:48:32.351
What's going on here?

424
00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.894
We... went...

425
00:48:38.365 --> 00:48:39.855
Can I go see the sheep?

426
00:48:44.571 --> 00:48:47.062
- What's the matter with you?
- She is blind.

427
00:48:47.107 --> 00:48:50.235
What's wrong with you today,
are you blind?

428
00:48:50.277 --> 00:48:54.407
Clean it, damn you.
Clean it up.

429
00:48:54.448 --> 00:48:57.246
Come on, come on.

430
00:50:54.743 --> 00:50:56.404
Listen to me.

431
00:50:57.379 --> 00:51:00.280
From now on, I'll be
getting home late from work,

432
00:51:00.315 --> 00:51:02.306
so you have to get
the groceries.

433
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:05.877
You buy bread, milk
and that's all.

434
00:51:05.921 --> 00:51:07.855
Understood?

435
00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:10.423
Where is the store?

436
00:51:10.459 --> 00:51:14.361
It's just there, you go
straight down, and you turn.

437
00:51:14.396 --> 00:51:16.193
Understood?

438
00:51:18.833 --> 00:51:21.427
This is 10 francs.

439
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.802
10 francs.

440
00:51:23.838 --> 00:51:28.832
Don't forget the change.
You got it?

441
00:51:28.886 --> 00:51:30.547
Yes.

442
00:51:40.322 --> 00:51:41.550
Hurry up.

443
00:51:56.838 --> 00:51:58.328
Let's go.

444
00:52:27.369 --> 00:52:29.803
What are you doing?

445
00:52:29.838 --> 00:52:32.329
I saw you digging
last night.

446
00:52:32.374 --> 00:52:35.172
Are you doing
the contest?

447
00:52:36.211 --> 00:52:40.671
It's mint.
I'm growing mint.

448
00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:43.750
You have to plant
mint at night.

449
00:52:43.785 --> 00:52:47.277
It's going
to invade my garden.

450
00:52:47.322 --> 00:52:49.847
It grows
like a weed.

451
00:52:49.891 --> 00:52:51.722
Weed?

452
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:38.395
- There you go, Mrs. Leroy.
- Thank you.

453
00:53:38.439 --> 00:53:40.430
Have a nice day.

454
00:53:40.475 --> 00:53:43.911
What can I do
for you, madame?

455
00:53:43.945 --> 00:53:48.314
I need a little bit...

456
00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.717
A bit of what?

457
00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.478
- The beef.
- What piece of beef?

458
00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:02.355
- The beef.
- Miss Luni, please.

459
00:54:02.397 --> 00:54:05.025
- As you like. The usual.
- Roasting meat?

460
00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:09.705
Milk, bread...

461
00:54:09.738 --> 00:54:11.968
Milk, that's just behind
the vegetables.

462
00:54:12.774 --> 00:54:15.368
Yes, yes,
I'll take care of it.

463
00:54:17.579 --> 00:54:21.310
So what is it you want?
Milk, bread, beef?

464
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:24.512
Milk, bread, beef.

465
00:54:25.653 --> 00:54:29.680
How many steaks for the beef?
Two, three-- how many?

466
00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:32.429
Four.
All right, that's done.

467
00:54:33.161 --> 00:54:35.721
- Goodbye, Mrs. Muzar.
- Bye.

468
00:54:36.898 --> 00:54:40.732
So, what do we have?
Meat.

469
00:54:45.207 --> 00:54:48.074
That makes 34.

470
00:54:45.207 --> 00:54:47.368
Good lord, this is where
she puts her money.

471
00:54:52.747 --> 00:54:56.342
Is that all you have?
That's not enough.

472
00:54:56.384 --> 00:54:59.717
Well, never mind,
I'll put you down for credit.

473
00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:02.891
You're the newcomer,
near the Donzes, aren't you?

474
00:55:04.793 --> 00:55:06.420
So what's your name?

475
00:55:06.461 --> 00:55:08.520
Zouina.

476
00:55:10.231 --> 00:55:12.893
There you 90--
"Mr. Zouino"...

477
00:55:12.934 --> 00:55:15.664
34.

478
00:55:15.704 --> 00:55:17.831
Mr. Zouino
has to pay every month.

479
00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:20.315
You understand?
Every month.

480
00:55:20.342 --> 00:55:22.367
We're done!

481
00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.951
Are you okay?
Very well, then. Goodbye!

482
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:10.189
Let's see--
"Memory," "Misery"...

483
00:56:10.225 --> 00:56:12.989
"Wild Mint.

484
00:56:15.063 --> 00:56:18.863
Also known as a native

485
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:22.131
species of France.

486
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:25.731
Pepper Mint."

487
00:56:26.875 --> 00:56:29.070
- Hello, Ménie’?
- Yes.

488
00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:34.013
Well, two years ago,
I was 14, and I fell in love.

489
00:56:34.049 --> 00:56:36.040
So you must be 16 now.

490
00:56:36.084 --> 00:56:40.214
Yes, this boy and I were
classmates, he was 16.

491
00:56:40.255 --> 00:56:44.715
You know, I was very much
in love with him.

492
00:56:44.759 --> 00:56:48.024
He was my first love,
but I never told him, of course.

493
00:56:48.062 --> 00:56:49.996
Yes, I presume!

494
00:56:50.031 --> 00:56:52.864
They say 14 years old
is too young to love,

495
00:56:52.901 --> 00:56:56.302
but they're wrong.
I was so in love.

496
00:56:56.337 --> 00:56:59.033
I kept on waiting,
I stopped working in class.

497
00:56:59.074 --> 00:57:03.511
Well, there's nothing strange
or tragic about that.

498
00:57:03.545 --> 00:57:06.742
I know my situation
wasn't desperate,

499
00:57:06.781 --> 00:57:08.772
but it was
a real disaster.

500
00:57:08.816 --> 00:57:11.580
What do you mean
by "disaster"?

501
00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:17.422
Did you talk about
it with your mother?

502
00:57:17.458 --> 00:57:20.689
I know my mother would say
that I'm too young.

503
00:57:20.728 --> 00:57:23.856
She doesn't want me to go out,
she never knew about him.

504
00:57:23.898 --> 00:57:25.695
What then?

505
00:57:25.733 --> 00:57:28.725
He went out with another girl
from our class.

506
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.150
Can you open the door?

507
00:57:48.189 --> 00:57:51.283
Madame, it's a game.
I ask you a question,

508
00:57:51.326 --> 00:57:53.851
if you give the right answer,
you win.

509
00:57:53.895 --> 00:57:56.955
Is it like
"One Thousand Francs"?

510
00:57:56.998 --> 00:58:00.092
Yes, yes... "One Thousand Francs,"
you could say that.

511
00:58:00.135 --> 00:58:03.070
Listen carefully
to the question.

512
00:58:03.104 --> 00:58:06.005
What cleans your carpet,

513
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.840
eats up dust,
doesn't cost much,

514
00:58:09.877 --> 00:58:12.778
and is your best friend
for all times?

515
00:58:12.814 --> 00:58:17.751
Well, madame,
I'm sure you know.

516
00:58:17.786 --> 00:58:20.084
I repeat!

517
00:58:20.121 --> 00:58:23.557
It cleans your carpet,
eats up dust...

518
00:58:23.591 --> 00:58:26.560
- lt's...’?
- The broom!

519
00:58:26.594 --> 00:58:29.529
Yes, yes... a broom!

520
00:58:29.572 --> 00:58:33.235
Bravo, madame, congratulations.
That wasn't easy.

521
00:58:33.267 --> 00:58:36.293
Yes, a broom.
An electrical broom.

522
00:58:36.337 --> 00:58:39.329
You can also call it
a vacuum cleaner.

523
00:58:39.374 --> 00:58:41.569
You're the winner
of the neighborhood.

524
00:58:41.609 --> 00:58:44.407
You just have to sign
this form.

525
00:58:44.445 --> 00:58:48.609
I will bring your wonderful present
offered by the Malliard stores.

526
00:58:51.352 --> 00:58:53.547
There's our lucky winner!

527
00:58:54.555 --> 00:58:56.546
Good Lord!

528
00:58:59.694 --> 00:59:01.559
Plug?

529
00:59:07.235 --> 00:59:09.829
The switch.

530
00:59:12.574 --> 00:59:13.905
It's perfect
for the carpet.

531
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:24.285
Try it,
see for yourself.

532
00:59:24.318 --> 00:59:29.085
Your wife signed
for all the installments.

533
00:59:29.123 --> 00:59:33.287
Here is the contract.
I've come for the first payment.

534
00:59:33.328 --> 00:59:36.491
I'll come back every month,
same day.

535
00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:39.193
You only have
11 installments left.

536
00:59:39.234 --> 00:59:43.330
He said I won.
He said the "One Thousand Francs."

537
00:59:43.379 --> 00:59:46.177
What thousand francs?

538
00:59:46.207 --> 00:59:48.869
It's better this way.

539
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:51.777
- I need to think.
- Well, that's already done, sir.

540
00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:54.312
- Your wife signed.
- She signed?

541
00:59:54.357 --> 00:59:55.551
She signed.

542
00:59:57.252 --> 00:59:58.583
She signed?

543
01:00:00.963 --> 01:00:02.362
You know
how to sign, now?

544
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:04.756
Since she opens
the door to everyone,

545
01:00:04.792 --> 01:00:07.124
I'm going to bring you
a second wife.

546
01:00:07.161 --> 01:00:09.527
- That's not true!
- Yes, it is!

547
01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:12.727
Because your mother
opens the door to everybody.

548
01:00:14.269 --> 01:00:17.432
Damn the boat
that brought you here!

549
01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.389
Zouina, wait!

550
01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:32.826
Did you go shopping?

551
01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:34.955
What did you buy?

552
01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.626
- There's something wrong?
- I'm fine.

553
01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:46.074
You're very nice to me...

554
01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:47.940
like a sister.

555
01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:50.468
I like you very much.

556
01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:00.485
Bye, Zouina!

557
01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:23.779
Oh, Mother!

558
01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:34.255
I have a secret
that only I know.

559
01:01:34.298 --> 01:01:38.291
lam hiding a sadness,
an eternal love.)

560
01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:43.527
An eternal love
an eternal love.

561
01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:48.196
My eye is crying,
my heart is broken.

562
01:01:48.237 --> 01:01:52.970
My eye is crying,
my heart is broken,

563
01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:57.742
To my country I'm going back
to see my friends and family.

564
01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:02.649
To my country I'm going back
to see my friends and family.

565
01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:45.593
Who is it?

566
01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:48.358
It's Mrs. Manant,
the colonel's widow!

567
01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:50.025
Do you remember me?

568
01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:52.466
Who is it?

569
01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:57.438
- Can I come in?
- No, I can't, I can't.

570
01:02:57.473 --> 01:03:00.203
- Who is she?
- Hello, madame!

571
01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:03.110
It's the woman
from the grocery store.

572
01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.273
The grocer's...

573
01:03:08.715 --> 01:03:08.715
...

574
01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:07.475
Sit down.

575
01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:33.802
Zouina, I want
to thank you for Simca.

576
01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:38.246
This is a beautiful book
on Algeria.

577
01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:41.045
How can she know
about Algeria?

578
01:03:41.084 --> 01:03:46.249
Poor Algeria.
I left Algeria behind.

579
01:03:46.297 --> 01:03:50.199
All my life, I worked hard,
it's God's will.

580
01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:53.093
I suffered,
I worked for the settlers.

581
01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:56.758
I was beaten with a cane.

582
01:03:56.799 --> 01:04:01.759
I was never fortunate.
But I am grateful.

583
01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:07.599
Go and make some coffee.

584
01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:20.015
Excuse me.

585
01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:36.301
Tell me about Simca.
Does she have a real grave?

586
01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:39.502
Yes, it's
all over for her!

587
01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:43.638
Don't say a word!
She is very mean!

588
01:04:50.594 --> 01:04:53.461
lknow where
the Bouiras' house is.

589
01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:56.424
Lou-- Louette Street?

590
01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:59.326
No-- "Alouette."

591
01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:01.592
I've tried,
but I can't find it.

592
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:04.098
You'll help me won't you?
You'll help me?

593
01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:06.158
Of course
I will help you.

594
01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:08.864
- Sugar?
- No thank you. I never take sugar.

595
01:05:08.913 --> 01:05:11.609
- Sugar.
- No, thank you.

596
01:05:12.775 --> 01:05:16.176
You must leave.
Please go.

597
01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:18.679
All right,
but you must come to see me.

598
01:05:18.722 --> 01:05:20.246
Leave now. Now.

599
01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:23.309
- Goodbye, madame!
- Goodbye.

600
01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:41.697
Coffee without sugar?

601
01:05:41.738 --> 01:05:43.000
I don't get it.

602
01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.700
It's poison.

603
01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:02.549
"Dear friends, thank you.

604
01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:07.829
Dear friends, I am proud...

605
01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:11.560
to see my hard work
rewarded at last.

606
01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:16.060
I would like to thank
the company, "Good Seed"...

607
01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:22.034
who helped me give
my flowers their brightness.

608
01:06:24.546 --> 01:06:27.037
We won, we did it.

609
01:06:33.722 --> 01:06:36.885
We won, in spite
of the
obstacles.

610
01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:42.186
And believe me,
there were many...

611
01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.224
...obstac
es

612
01:06:49.313 --> 01:06:52.111
Lucienne, my little flower,
who are you talking to?

613
01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:59.574
Here.

614
01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:11.292
Dear God.

615
01:08:26.344 --> 01:08:29.006
Have some orange juice,
children.

616
01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:36.946
No? Would you like
some cookies, then?

617
01:08:42.459 --> 01:08:45.053
Wait, I need
to talk to you.

618
01:08:45.096 --> 01:08:47.724
Come on, children,
go and play in the garden.

619
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.230
I'll be right back.

620
01:10:03.774 --> 01:10:07.232
I can only be there
at 3 o'clock.

621
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:40.782
What does the sheep
look like?

622
01:10:40.811 --> 01:10:42.005
It's so big,

623
01:10:42.046 --> 01:10:44.844
it won't get
through the door.

624
01:12:10.434 --> 01:12:14.632
What are you doing?
Making pastry with your face?

625
01:12:14.672 --> 01:12:17.038
What's the matter
with you?

626
01:12:17.074 --> 01:12:19.975
Look at your face!
I swear once and for all...

627
01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:23.309
I swear I'm going
to go to Algiers...

628
01:12:23.347 --> 01:12:26.145
and bring
the second wife here.

629
01:12:26.183 --> 01:12:30.017
She scrubs all day.
Get that into your head!

630
01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:31.851
Look at your face!

631
01:12:33.357 --> 01:12:36.986
Do you want to beat me?
Oh God, what a curse!

632
01:12:37.027 --> 01:12:39.518
God will punish you

633
01:12:39.563 --> 01:12:42.191
for all the evil things
you're doing to us.

634
01:12:42.232 --> 01:12:43.722
God save us.

635
01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.657
Want to take my picture?

636
01:13:12.797 --> 01:13:15.288
You don't like it?

637
01:13:22.373 --> 01:13:24.841
Nicole.

638
01:13:24.875 --> 01:13:26.843
I brought you a present.

639
01:13:30.447 --> 01:13:33.075
Have a look.

640
01:13:39.522 --> 01:13:42.423
Do you like it?

641
01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.628
I got you this pearly lipstick,
just like mine.

642
01:13:55.673 --> 01:13:57.698
This is for the cheeks.

643
01:13:57.741 --> 01:14:01.609
Last but not least, a small
bottle of "Nuit d'lvresse."

644
01:14:08.919 --> 01:14:11.046
It smells good.

645
01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:14.488
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

646
01:14:17.461 --> 01:14:19.986
Take a look,
there are different colors.

647
01:14:36.947 --> 01:14:39.313
If she sees this...

648
01:14:39.358 --> 01:14:41.758
she'll kill me.

649
01:14:41.785 --> 01:14:43.514
Kill you?

650
01:14:50.561 --> 01:14:53.257
I went through that too.
The mother-in-law.

651
01:14:53.297 --> 01:14:55.993
Husband, mother-in-law--
for me, it's all over now.

652
01:15:04.808 --> 01:15:07.936
Then I found myself here.

653
01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.641
She's going to bring
the second wife.

654
01:15:12.683 --> 01:15:15.379
What?
The second wife?

655
01:15:16.687 --> 01:15:18.314
My sister-in-law's sister.

656
01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:20.818
He doesn't have the right.

657
01:15:22.526 --> 01:15:24.721
Yes he does.

658
01:15:26.129 --> 01:15:28.529
In our country,
he even has the right to four.

659
01:15:28.565 --> 01:15:30.430
Like Africans?

660
01:15:28.565 --> 01:15:31.261
I'm the first, so...

661
01:15:39.009 --> 01:15:41.807
I must give you a book
by that woman--

662
01:15:41.845 --> 01:15:45.747
what's it called?
The word "sex" is in the title.

663
01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:48.316
I don't remember.
Anyway, it'll come back to me.

664
01:15:48.352 --> 01:15:51.913
This woman says that we need
to manage our sexuality.

665
01:15:51.955 --> 01:15:54.480
Your body belongs to you.

666
01:15:55.893 --> 01:15:59.021
My body belongs to me!
I'm the one who decides.

667
01:16:00.997 --> 01:16:04.933
I listened on the radio,
just after "One Thousand Francs."

668
01:16:04.968 --> 01:16:07.129
Oh, I like
"One Thousand Francs."

669
01:16:09.072 --> 01:16:12.769
I've set up an organization
for divorced women...

670
01:16:13.276 --> 01:16:16.336
Besides my job.

671
01:16:17.681 --> 01:16:21.344
We hang out,
we go dancing.

672
01:16:21.385 --> 01:16:23.285
You could come
with us sometime.

673
01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.881
Oh, no!
It's a sin.

674
01:16:29.093 --> 01:16:31.755
Oh, my goodness.

675
01:16:39.102 --> 01:16:42.037
Here's a ray of sunshine.

676
01:16:42.072 --> 01:16:44.836
I'd better not miss it.

677
01:17:00.565 --> 01:17:02.999
The usual, milk, bread?

678
01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:05.401
I added some sardines.
They're on sale.

679
01:17:05.437 --> 01:17:07.997
I'll write it down,
as usual.

680
01:19:38.223 --> 01:19:41.681
Look what happens
when you turn your back, son.

681
01:19:41.726 --> 01:19:46.288
Under your own roof.
Look what I found.

682
01:19:46.331 --> 01:19:49.664
France is messing up
her brain.

683
01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:52.261
She wants to be
like French women.

684
01:19:54.473 --> 01:19:59.172
I don't know what this book is.
Look what's in this bag.

685
01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:01.179
Have a good look!

686
01:20:01.212 --> 01:20:04.409
- Where did she get this?
- That I don't know!

687
01:20:04.449 --> 01:20:07.907
If you want to keep your honor,
and your moustache...

688
01:20:07.953 --> 01:20:10.945
- Where did she get this?
- Ask her!

689
01:20:10.989 --> 01:20:13.355
Where did you
get this from?

690
01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:14.654
Damn you!

691
01:20:14.693 --> 01:20:18.652
Where did you get this?

692
01:20:18.696 --> 01:20:21.130
You know how to read now?
You know how to read now’?

693
01:20:22.434 --> 01:20:24.800
You know how to read now?
Goddamn you!

694
01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:29.126
See you later.

695
01:22:41.315 --> 01:22:43.943
Who is it?

696
01:22:45.119 --> 01:22:47.246
I'm looking for Bouira.

697
01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:50.162
- Mouloud, who is it?
- I don't know!

698
01:22:52.592 --> 01:22:54.856
Are you Bouira’?

699
01:22:56.329 --> 01:22:58.695
Come inside.

700
01:23:02.602 --> 01:23:05.230
Please, come in.

701
01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:19.712
Go and play outside.

702
01:23:23.656 --> 01:23:26.682
Take your coat off.
Welcome.

703
01:23:26.726 --> 01:23:29.593
I'm Zouina.

704
01:23:30.764 --> 01:23:33.358
My name is Malika,
I'm from Annaba.

705
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:53.283
Make yourself comfortable.

706
01:23:58.291 --> 01:24:02.625
As soon as I learned you lived here,
I wanted to visit you.

707
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:07.797
I'll make some coffee.

708
01:24:29.823 --> 01:24:32.724
You just arrived too?

709
01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.724
14...

710
01:24:36.763 --> 01:24:38.594
15 years...

711
01:24:38.631 --> 01:24:42.089
15 years here in France.

712
01:24:42.135 --> 01:24:44.330
15 years?

713
01:24:51.144 --> 01:24:53.635
Where is your man?

714
01:24:54.781 --> 01:24:56.942
Where is he?

715
01:25:16.169 --> 01:25:18.603
She is beautiful.

716
01:25:18.638 --> 01:25:21.402
Go get the semolina.

717
01:25:21.441 --> 01:25:23.306
Go.

718
01:25:25.645 --> 01:25:28.205
Unfortunately,
I have three daughters.

719
01:25:38.124 --> 01:25:40.752
But I don't worry
for her anymore.

720
01:25:40.794 --> 01:25:43.661
Her father promised her
to a cousin.

721
01:25:43.696 --> 01:25:45.960
I'm not worried for her.

722
01:25:45.999 --> 01:25:48.763
lam very lucky.

723
01:25:52.071 --> 01:25:55.006
How about your husband?

724
01:25:57.318 --> 01:25:59.718
Where is he?

725
01:26:06.986 --> 01:26:09.511
Pour.

726
01:26:12.224 --> 01:26:14.658
Enough.

727
01:26:24.804 --> 01:26:27.102
Do you listen
to the radio?

728
01:26:27.139 --> 01:26:30.108
Do you know the game
"One Thousand Francs"?

729
01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:33.286
You don't.

730
01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:35.812
Do you know
"Ménie Grégoire"?

731
01:26:35.848 --> 01:26:39.147
That's French women--
they talk.

732
01:26:39.185 --> 01:26:41.710
They talk
about sexuality, love...

733
01:26:42.822 --> 01:26:47.589
Sexuality?
That's shameful!

734
01:26:50.596 --> 01:26:53.895
Talk on the radio...
Pour.

735
01:26:54.801 --> 01:26:57.201
That's enough.

736
01:27:00.673 --> 01:27:03.301
That's France.

737
01:27:05.278 --> 01:27:07.508
Malika...

738
01:27:07.547 --> 01:27:10.573
I've been looking for you
for three Sundays.

739
01:27:10.616 --> 01:27:14.245
I've been looking,
looking all over.

740
01:27:14.287 --> 01:27:17.415
I've crossed fields, roads--

741
01:27:17.457 --> 01:27:19.186
I looked and looked
and I couldn't find you!

742
01:27:19.225 --> 01:27:23.252
It's the French woman,
she brought me here in a taxi.

743
01:27:23.304 --> 01:27:26.501
I want to celebrate A'I'd
with you and the children.

744
01:27:26.532 --> 01:27:29.695
The woman is gone crazy!

745
01:27:29.735 --> 01:27:33.637
Cursed be the devil!

746
01:27:33.673 --> 01:27:35.868
Your husband,
he says nothing?

747
01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:36.884
You don't understand.

748
01:27:42.882 --> 01:27:44.406
You always ask
about my husband.

749
01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:47.246
My husband
doesn't know anything.

750
01:27:49.256 --> 01:27:51.190
You don't hide things
from your husband?

751
01:27:52.425 --> 01:27:54.416
She's completely mad!

752
01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:58.521
As if I don't have enough problems!
You want me dead?

753
01:27:58.573 --> 01:28:01.201
Get out of my house.
Get the hell out of here.

754
01:28:01.242 --> 01:28:03.710
Out!

755
01:28:03.736 --> 01:28:06.136
With all the troubles
I already have?

756
01:28:06.172 --> 01:28:07.332
Leave this place--
leave my house.

757
01:28:07.373 --> 01:28:09.466
Out!

758
01:28:12.378 --> 01:28:14.107
Trouble...
This is trouble!

759
01:28:16.616 --> 01:28:20.143
Get out!
Mouloud, get inside!

760
01:28:38.805 --> 01:28:41.706
Malika!

761
01:28:41.741 --> 01:28:44.471
Malika, open the door!

762
01:28:45.411 --> 01:28:48.073
Please, let me in.
Malika!

763
01:28:48.114 --> 01:28:51.174
Please, don't abandon me!

764
01:28:51.751 --> 01:28:54.743
Malika, don't abandon me!

765
01:28:54.787 --> 01:28:57.585
I beg you!

766
01:29:11.613 --> 01:29:13.877
Open the door!

767
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.492
Don't leave me out here!

768
01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.169
Malika!

769
01:30:00.153 --> 01:30:01.916
Don't abandon me.

770
01:30:01.954 --> 01:30:04.388
Don't leave me here.

771
01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:28.415
Are you hurt?

772
01:31:28.458 --> 01:31:30.858
No, it's okay.

773
01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:38.887
No, please, no!

774
01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:41.690
Just seeing you here is--

775
01:31:41.728 --> 01:31:44.026
Come on,
get a move on!

776
01:31:46.442 --> 01:31:48.637
Please, stay by my side.

777
01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:52.772
Everybody off the bus.

778
01:31:52.807 --> 01:31:55.367
This is the last stop,
get off.

779
01:31:56.586 --> 01:31:58.816
Out!

780
01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:39.706
You idiot, we've been
waiting for four hours!

781
01:33:39.756 --> 01:33:42.156
We were sick with worry!

782
01:33:42.183 --> 01:33:44.651
- Shame on you!
- Shut your mouth!

783
01:33:44.693 --> 01:33:47.287
From now on,
you don't say a thing.

784
01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:49.983
Leave her alone.
Go away!

785
01:33:53.194 --> 01:33:56.186
Look what France
has done to me.

786
01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:59.222
My son's screaming at me
before the A'I'd.

787
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:25.816
Tomorrow...

788
01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:29.352
I'll be the one
taking you to school.
